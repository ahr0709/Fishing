                    Niagara Falls /naɪˈæɡrə, naɪˈæɡərə/ is a group of three
                    waterfalls at the southern end of Niagara Gorge, spanning the
                    border between the province of Ontario in Canada and the state
                    of New York in the United States. The largest of the three is
                    Horseshoe Falls, also known as Canadian Falls, which straddles
                    the international border of the two countries.[1] The smaller
                    American Falls and Bridal Veil Falls lie within the United
                    States. Bridal Veil Falls is separated from Horseshoe Falls by
                    Goat Island and from American Falls by Luna Island, with both
                    islands situated in New York.

                    Yellowstone National Park is an American national park located
                    in the western United States, largely in the northwest corner of
                    Wyoming and extending into Montana and Idaho. It was established
                    by the U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Ulysses S.
                    Grant on March 1, 1872.[6][7][8] Yellowstone was the first
                    national park in the U.S. and is also widely held to be the
                    first national park in the world.[9] The park is known for its
                    wildlife and its many geothermal features, especially Old
                    Faithful geyser, one of its most popular.[10] While it
                    represents many types of biomes, the subalpine forest is the
                    most abundant. It is part of the South Central Rockies forests
                    ecoregion.
